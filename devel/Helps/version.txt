Version 3.1 (15/04-2006):   This version includes the following updates:
Additional parameters such as
  - the intial contacts  (EQUIL)
  - fault multipliers    (MULTFLT)
  - vertical multipliers (MULTZ)
can now be estimated.

An xls spreadsheed is now used to define all priors, for petrophysics, and
other parameters.   This simplifies the generation of priors significantly
and no code needs to be altered.

Only the active grid points are now stored in the ensemble files.   Thus,
the user will need to specify the number of active grid points before the
final compilation.    Also, the poro and perm variables are stored in packed 
for for only the active grid points.  For the static files it is again assumed
that the record sized for the different members at a particular time step are
equal.    This optimized the required storage of ensemble files, and also the
length of the vectors that need to operated on in the analysis and post
processing schemes.

Switched to randrot call in sample2D.

Now also outputs OPT, GPT and WPT in summary files in Diag.

Version 3.0 (01/01-2006):   The original ksh program used to control all the EnKF
realated programs has been replaced with a Fortran 90 program main.F90 which
now integrates all the code into one program.  This simplifies debugging and
code maintanence.

The new version also includes automatic generation of the code needed to
interface ECLIPSE.   Thus, there is no manual generation of interfaces to 
ECLIPSE restart and summary files.   Further,  the schedule file can be 
generated automatically.
